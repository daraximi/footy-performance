## Player Performance & Injury Forecaster 
This project focuses on predicting player performance and the likelihood of injuries.

The Core Idea
Create an iOS app for fantasy football players and fans that provides predictions on player performance for upcoming matches and flags players at high risk of injury.

AI/Data Science Component
Data Collection: Scrape data from football statistics websites like FBref or Understat. This will give you detailed player and team statistics that are not available in a clean, structured format. You'll need to handle web scraping complexities like dynamic content and rate limiting.

Modeling:
Performance Prediction: Develop a model (e.g., a Gradient Boosting model or a neural network) to predict key performance indicators for players in upcoming matches (e.g., goals, assists, chances created). Features could include historical performance, opponent strength, and team form.
Injury Prediction: Build a classification model to predict the probability of a player getting injured in the near future. Features could include minutes played, type of recent injuries, and player age.
Backend: A Python backend to handle the data scraping, model training (which can be a scheduled job), and provide predictions via an API. AWS Free Tier with services like EC2 for hosting and S3 for data storage would be a good fit.

iOS App (Swift)
Player Profiles: Display detailed statistics and performance predictions for each player.
Injury Risk Alerts: Show an "injury risk" score for players and provide details on why the model has flagged them.
Fantasy Football Assistant: Allow users to create their fantasy team within the app and get personalized recommendations on transfers and captaincy choices based on your model's outputs.
Data Visualization: Use charts and graphs to visualize player performance trends and injury risk over time.
